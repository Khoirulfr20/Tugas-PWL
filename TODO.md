# TODO: Fix Queue Creation Patient Selection Issue

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Modified routes/api.php to load all patients if no search, limit 10 if search
- [x] Updated resources/views/queues/create.blade.php JavaScript to use API search on input instead of loading all patients locally

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the patient search functionality in the queue creation form
- [ ] Verify that all patients can be found and selected
- [ ] Ensure queue creation works after selecting a patient
- [ ] Check for any console errors in browser developer tools
